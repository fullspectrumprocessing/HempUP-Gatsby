              CBD is short for cannabidiol. Cannabidiol is an extract from hemp, a commonly used term for strains of the cannabis sativa plant with very low levels of THC. Today, hemp is used in a wide range of products in the United States and globally.

              CBD is legal in all 50 states. The FDA considers hemp and hemp-derived extracts to be food-based products, so there are no legal restrictions on their importation, production, sale or consumption in the United States, as well as many other countries. Hemp oil is legal in over 40 countries around the world. Hemp oil is consumed by millions of people, and this number is rapidly rising as an increasing number of studies explore hempâ€™s many health benefits.

              The difference between marijuana and hemp is the percentage of THC. They are both types of cannabis plants, but industrial hemp is a plant with less than 0.3% THC by dry weight while marijuana has far more than that. CBD derived from industrial hemp, such as ours, is legal at the federal level. Marijuana remains illegal at the federal level.
