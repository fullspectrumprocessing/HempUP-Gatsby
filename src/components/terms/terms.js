            <S.P>
              Once an order is processed and shipped, it may take up to 2 full
              business days before the package is checked into the delivering
              carrier’s tracking system after shipment. That means even though
              your package has already shipped from our warehouse and is on its
              way to you, the carrier (UPS) may not be able to provide any
              information about your package for up to 2 full business days.
